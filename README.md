> ### Feature
> This paper tries to solve multiple single-image-based warping problems in a unified framework.

The above figure shows three examples of our method. The proposed CoupledTPS corrects (a) the 2D in-plane tilt, (b) irregular boundaries, and (c) wide-angle portrait via a unified warping framework.

## Code
We will release the code once the paper is accepted.
